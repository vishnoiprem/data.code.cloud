Designing a tag management system for a hotel management system that reads review comments from an SQL database and creates searchable tags involves several key components. Here’s a comprehensive design focusing on the primary requirement of creating tags from review comments and enabling customers to search hotels based on these tags.



High-Level Architecture

	1.	Data Ingestion and Processing:
	•	Continuously read review comments from the SQL database.
	•	Process these comments to extract relevant tags using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
	2.	Tag Storage:
	•	Store extracted tags along with the associated hotel information in a database optimized for fast search queries.
	3.	Search Service:
	•	Provide an API for customers to search for hotels based on tags.


Detailed Design

1. Data Ingestion and Processing

Components:

	•	SQL Database: Stores raw review comments.
	•	Data Ingestion Service: Reads review comments from the SQL database.
	•	NLP Processor: Processes review comments to extract relevant tags.


Data Ingestion Service:

	•	Use a scheduled job or a streaming service (e.g., Apache Kafka) to fetch new reviews from the SQL database continuously.
	•	If using a scheduled job, set it to run frequently enough to handle 500 reviews per second.

NLP Processor:

	•	Use NLP libraries like spaCy or NLTK to process review comments.
	•	Extract tags based on predefined keywords or use a machine learning model to identify relevant tags.



import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_tags(review_comment):
    doc = nlp(review_comment)
    tags = set()
    for chunk in doc.noun_chunks:
        tags.add(chunk.text.lower())
    return tags

# Example usage
review_comment = "The hotel had a good location and excellent service."
tags = extract_tags(review_comment)
print(tags)  # Output: {'good location', 'excellent service'}



Pipeline Example Using Apache Kafka:

	•	Producer: Writes new review comments to a Kafka topic.
	•	Consumer: Reads from the Kafka topic and processes the comments to extract tags.


from kafka import KafkaConsumer, KafkaProducer
import json

# Kafka setup
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'))
consumer = KafkaConsumer('review_comments', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode('utf-8')))

# NLP Processor
def extract_tags(review_comment):
    doc = nlp(review_comment)
    tags = set()
    for chunk in doc.noun_chunks:
        tags.add(chunk.text.lower())
    return tags

# Consume and process messages
for message in consumer:
    review = message.value
    tags = extract_tags(review['comment'])
    # Produce the tags to another Kafka topic or store in a database
    producer.send('tags', {'hotel_id': review['hotel_id'], 'tags': list(tags)})


 2. Tag Storage

Components:

	•	NoSQL Database (e.g., Elasticsearch, MongoDB): Stores tags and allows for efficient searching.


	Schema Design:

	•	Store each review with its associated tags.
	•	Create an index on the tags to optimize search queries.

Example Schema (Elasticsearch):


{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "hotel_id": { "type": "keyword" },
      "review_id": { "type": "keyword" },
      "tags": { "type": "text" }
    }
  }
}

3. Search Service
Components:

	•	API Service: Provides endpoints for searching hotels based on tags.
	•	Search Engine (e.g., Elasticsearch): Handles search queries and returns results.



Search API:

	•	Implement a RESTful API that takes a tag as a query parameter and returns the top 10 hotels with that tag.



from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

app = Flask(__name__)
es = Elasticsearch()

@app.route('/search', methods=['GET'])
def search_hotels():
    tag = request.args.get('tag')
    if not tag:
        return jsonify({"error": "Tag is required"}), 400

    query = {
        "size": 10,
        "query": {
            "match": {
                "tags": tag
            }
        }
    }
    response = es.search(index="hotel_reviews", body=query)
    results = [{"hotel_id": hit["_source"]["hotel_id"], "tags": hit["_source"]["tags"]} for hit in response["hits"]["hits"]]
    return jsonify(results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)


 Workflow

1.	Data Ingestion:
	•	The data ingestion service reads new review comments from the SQL database continuously.
	•	These comments are passed to the NLP processor.
2.	Tag Extraction:
	•	The NLP processor extracts relevant tags from each review comment.
	•	Extracted tags and associated hotel and review IDs are stored in Elasticsearch.
3.	Search:
	•	When a customer searches for a tag, the API service queries Elasticsearch.
	•	Elasticsearch returns the top 10 hotels with the matching tag.


Scalability Considerations

	•	Load Balancing: Use load balancers to distribute the traffic evenly across multiple instances of the API and data ingestion services.
	•	Caching: Implement caching mechanisms for frequently searched tags to reduce load on Elasticsearch.
	•	Batch Processing: If real-time processing becomes a bottleneck, consider batching review comments and processing them in bulk.

	•	Payment: id, payer, payee, amount
	•	Relationships:
	•	A user can belong to multiple groups.
	•	A group can have multiple bills.
	•	A bill can have multiple payments.

General Preparation Tips:

	1.	Algorithms and Data Structures:
	•	Practice problems on arrays, strings, hashmaps, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
	•	Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal.
	2.	System Design:
	•	Review common system design topics like scalability, high availability, load balancing, caching, and microservices.
	•	Practice designing systems like URL shorteners, social networks, and e-commerce platforms.
	3.	Behavioral Questions:
	•	Prepare examples demonstrating leadership, teamwork, conflict resolution, and problem-solving.
	•	Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers.
	4.	Coding Practice:
	•	Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
	•	Practice coding in an interview setting (e.g., using a whiteboard or an online code editor).

On the Day of the Interview:

	•	Ensure a stable internet connection and a quiet environment.
	•	Have a notepad and pen ready for jotting down thoughts or questions.
